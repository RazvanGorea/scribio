# Scribio

Scribio is an app that lets you read and publish posts with some fancy features.

It was built mainly to try out the new 'On-Demand ISR' feature in next.js

Both frontend and backend are written in TypeScript.

The backend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/RazvanGorea/scribio-api-public).
